No one is posting long form content directly on LinkedIn, they make an infographic on LinkedIn and then link the article/blog related to it on their website. Our Competitors are doing same (BambooHR and LanteriaHR to be specific). I think this is the right way, as by doing this they get redirected to our website at same time and we get our traffic.

Conclusion:- Upload all the articles on website only, then make a short infographic like post on LinkedIn and link the article with it.
Where to start:-
We have these 4 blogs available on our website
1. What is true cost of hiring and onboarding?
2. Employee Onboarding Checklist
3. What is enabling effective onboarding?
4. The Changing paradigms of employee Onboarding.

We can make infographics type post for each of them and link these blogs to our website. We can start with these and then once we are completed with this stuff, we can start making more articles (Maybe next week)
